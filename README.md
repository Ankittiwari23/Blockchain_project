# Health Records Management Using Blockchain 
## Current Scenario 
In the healthcare industry, many organizations still rely on outdated systems to maintain patient health records. These antiquated software solutions store patient medical data in local records, which can result in several challenges:

**Time-Consuming Diagnosis**: The use of outdated systems can make the diagnosis process time-consuming. Doctors often struggle to access and retrieve essential patient information efficiently.

**Complexity for Healthcare Providers**: Outdated software systems can complicate the workflow for healthcare professionals. They may face difficulties in navigating and retrieving patient data, hindering their ability to provide timely and accurate care.

Healthcare organizations currently rely on centralized databases to store a wide range of data, including personal information, diagnostic reports, and doctor's prescriptions. However, this centralized approach brings with it a set of significant problems, such as:

**Identity Theft**: Centralized databases are vulnerable to breaches, potentially leading to identity theft. Unauthorized access to patient records can compromise sensitive personal information.

**Spamming**: Patient data stored in a centralized location can become a target for spamming and unsolicited communications, potentially jeopardizing patient privacy.


**Financial Data Crimes**: Centralized databases also pose a risk of financial data crimes. Hackers can exploit vulnerabilities to steal credit card and bank information, leading to unethical financial activities.

Securing patient data is paramount in the healthcare sector, as tampering with patient records can have severe consequences for both patients and healthcare providers. Notably, between the years 2009 and 2023, over 200 million patient records were breached. Hackers exploited these breaches to gain access to sensitive financial data and misuse it for nefarious purposes.

## Proposed Solution
This project will implement blockchain technology and Smart contracts for Electronic Health records  and also provide secure and scalable storage of electronic records by defining granular access rules for the users.

## Smart Contracts in heatlh care
Smart contracts are self-executing lines of code that run atop blockchains and are triggered once a set of predetermined conditions are met. They are used to automate the execution of online agreements without the involvement of third parties. Smart contracts can be used to create patient profiles on the blockchain while allowing doctors and relevant medical practitioners to view past medical records. This would allow them to come up with better treatment procedures based on a patient’s past treatment history and subsequent outcomes.Health centers can also configure smart contracts to track health complications arising from treatment side effects and encode them to share the information with partner drug manufacturing companies and medical associations that have yet to uncover the full side effects of new drugs.
It is additionally possible to have smart contracts that send patient information to insurance companies for the purposes of patient compensation claims to smooth out such processes.

## Future Scope of the project
Many healthcare organizations and blockchain companies are working on building blockchain-enabled systems to enhance healthcare services for both patients and healthcare professionals. This project can be extended to decentralize patient medical history, improving payment methods and tracking pharmaceuticals. Smart contracts can be used to create patient profiles on the blockchain while allowing doctors and relevant medical practitioners to view past medical records. This would allow them to come up with better treatment procedures based on a patient’s past treatment history and subsequent outcomes.

## Required Software Tools
1. Ethereum:
Contribution: Ethereum serves as the underlying blockchain platform, providing the decentralized ledger where health records are stored securely and immutably. It ensures data integrity, transparency, and resilience against unauthorized access or tampering.
Use Case: Ethereum is used to deploy and execute the HealthRecord smart contract, which manages the storage and retrieval of health records.
2. Solidity:
Contribution: Solidity is a critical tool for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows for the definition of data structures, functions, and access control logic within the smart contract.
Use Case: Solidity is used to code the HealthRecord smart contract, specifying how records are added, accessed, and secured.
3. React.js:
Contribution: React.js is a JavaScript library used for building dynamic and responsive user interfaces. It enables the creation of a user-friendly frontend application for interacting with the blockchain and smart contract.
Use Case: React.js is used to develop the patient dashboard and healthcare provider portal, providing users with intuitive interfaces to manage and access health records.
4. Web3.js:
Contribution: Web3.js is a JavaScript library that facilitates interaction with Ethereum smart contracts from a web application. It allows the frontend application to send transactions, query data, and monitor events on the blockchain.
Use Case: Web3.js is integrated into the React.js application to connect to the HealthRecord smart contract, enabling users to add records and retrieve patient data.
5. Truffle:
Contribution: Truffle are development and deployment tools for Ethereum smart contracts. They provide a development environment, testing framework, and deployment tools to streamline the smart contract development process.
Use Case: Truffle can be used to write, test, and deploy the HealthRecord smart contract to the Ethereum blockchain.
6. Ganache
Contribution: Use to create the local etherum network
