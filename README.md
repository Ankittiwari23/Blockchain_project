# Health Records Management Using Blockchain 
## Current Scenario 
Many healthcare organizations still depend on outdated systems to maintain patient health records. Such outdated software keeps the patient medical data in local records that can make the diagnosis:
###
1.time-consuming.
###
2.complicated for the doctor.
###
From the patient’s personal information to diagnostic reports and doctor’s prescriptions, healthcare organizations currently use the centralized database for saving data.
###
As the data is stored at a single centralized location, it leads to problems like: Identity thefts,spamming,financial data crimes
###
Due to data theft and spamming, the patient’s data can be misused for many reasons as they don’t control it.
## Introduction 
This project will implement blockchain technology for Electronic Health records  and also provide secure and scalable storage of electronic records by defining granular access rules for the users. 
## Future Scope of the project
Many healthcare organizations and blockchain companies are working on building blockchain-enabled systems to enhance healthcare services for both patients and healthcare professionals. This project can be extended to decentralize patient medical history, improving payment methods and tracking pharmaceuticals.

##Proposed Solution

##Required Software Tools:
1. Ethereum:
Contribution: Ethereum serves as the underlying blockchain platform, providing the decentralized ledger where health records are stored securely and immutably. It ensures data integrity, transparency, and resilience against unauthorized access or tampering.
Use Case: Ethereum is used to deploy and execute the HealthRecord smart contract, which manages the storage and retrieval of health records.
2. Solidity:
Contribution: Solidity is a critical tool for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows for the definition of data structures, functions, and access control logic within the smart contract.
Use Case: Solidity is used to code the HealthRecord smart contract, specifying how records are added, accessed, and secured.
3. React.js:
Contribution: React.js is a JavaScript library used for building dynamic and responsive user interfaces. It enables the creation of a user-friendly frontend application for interacting with the blockchain and smart contract.
Use Case: React.js is used to develop the patient dashboard and healthcare provider portal, providing users with intuitive interfaces to manage and access health records.
4. Web3.js:
Contribution: Web3.js is a JavaScript library that facilitates interaction with Ethereum smart contracts from a web application. It allows the frontend application to send transactions, query data, and monitor events on the blockchain.
Use Case: Web3.js is integrated into the React.js application to connect to the HealthRecord smart contract, enabling users to add records and retrieve patient data.
5. Truffle:
Contribution: Truffle are development and deployment tools for Ethereum smart contracts. They provide a development environment, testing framework, and deployment tools to streamline the smart contract development process.
Use Case: Truffle can be used to write, test, and deploy the HealthRecord smart contract to the Ethereum blockchain.
6. Ganache
Contribution: Use to create the local etherum network
