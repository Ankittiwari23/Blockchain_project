# Health Records Management Using Blockchain 
## Current Scenario 
In the healthcare industry, many organizations still rely on outdated systems to maintain patient health records. These antiquated software solutions store patient medical data in local records, which can result in several challenges:

**Time-Consuming Diagnosis**: The use of outdated systems can make the diagnosis process time-consuming. Doctors often struggle to access and retrieve essential patient information efficiently.

**Complexity for Healthcare Providers**: Outdated software systems can complicate the workflow for healthcare professionals. They may face difficulties in navigating and retrieving patient data, hindering their ability to provide timely and accurate care.

Healthcare organizations currently rely on centralized databases to store a wide range of data, including personal information, diagnostic reports, and doctor's prescriptions. However, this centralized approach brings with it a set of significant problems, such as:

**Identity Theft**: Centralized databases are vulnerable to breaches, potentially leading to identity theft. Unauthorized access to patient records can compromise sensitive personal information.

**Spamming**: Patient data stored in a centralized location can become a target for spamming and unsolicited communications, potentially jeopardizing patient privacy.


**Financial Data Crimes**: Centralized databases also pose a risk of financial data crimes. Hackers can exploit vulnerabilities to steal credit card and bank information, leading to unethical financial activities.

Securing patient data is paramount in the healthcare sector, as tampering with patient records can have severe consequences for both patients and healthcare providers. Notably, between the years 2009 and 2023, over 200 million patient records were breached. Hackers exploited these breaches to gain access to sensitive financial data and misuse it for nefarious purposes.

## Proposed Solution
This project will implement blockchain technology and Smart contracts for Electronic Health records  and also provide secure and scalable storage of electronic records by defining granular access rules for the users.

## Smart Contracts in health care
Smart contracts are self-executing lines of code that run atop blockchains and are triggered once a set of predetermined conditions are met. They are used to automate the execution of online agreements without the involvement of third parties. Smart contracts can be used to create patient profiles on the blockchain while allowing doctors and relevant medical practitioners to view past medical records. This would allow them to come up with better treatment procedures based on a patient’s past treatment history and subsequent outcomes.Health centers can also configure smart contracts to track health complications arising from treatment side effects and encode them to share the information with partner drug manufacturing companies and medical associations that have yet to uncover the full side effects of new drugs.
It is additionally possible to have smart contracts that send patient information to insurance companies for the purposes of patient compensation claims to smooth out such processes.

## Future Scope of the project
Many healthcare organizations and blockchain companies are working on building blockchain-enabled systems to enhance healthcare services for both patients and healthcare professionals. This project can be extended to decentralize patient medical history, improving payment methods and tracking pharmaceuticals. Smart contracts can be used to create patient profiles on the blockchain while allowing doctors and relevant medical practitioners to view past medical records. This would allow them to come up with better treatment procedures based on a patient’s past treatment history and subsequent outcomes.
