# Health Records Management Using Blockchain 
## Current Scenario 
Many healthcare organizations still depend on outdated systems to maintain patient health records. Such outdated software keeps the patient medical data in local records that can make the diagnosis:
###
1.time-consuming.
###
2.complicated for the doctor.
###
From the patient’s personal information to diagnostic reports and doctor’s prescriptions, healthcare organizations currently use the centralized database for saving data.
###
As the data is stored at a single centralized location, it leads to problems like: Identity thefts,spamming,financial data crimes
###
Due to data theft and spamming, the patient’s data can be misused for many reasons as they don’t control it.
## Introduction 
This project will implement blockchain technology for Electronic Health records  and also provide secure and scalable storage of electronic records by defining granular access rules for the users. 
## Future Scope of the project
Many healthcare organizations and blockchain companies are working on building blockchain-enabled systems to enhance healthcare services for both patients and healthcare professionals. This project can be extended to decentralize patient medical history, improving payment methods and tracking pharmaceuticals.
